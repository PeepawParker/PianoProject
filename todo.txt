Start on the measuring of a sounds frequency to then store in the database,
Each piano should have its own profile of keys mapped to the frequencies specified,
User should first specify how many keys, and piano name. This Piano in the database will then be linked to the Piano Keys database which will hold the frequencies of each of the notes that the user has in there. I might make it like one long text string and force the user to complete all the notes before they are allowed to play

Get a user store setup so the userInfo can be accessible from all of the pages

Start on the piano key tune setup page figure out how you are going to measure the sound and store it in the database

Eventually make it so that the range the listener accepts changes based on the current note its listening for
